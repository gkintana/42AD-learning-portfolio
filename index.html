						<h3>FT_Containers</h3>
						<p>
							My implementation of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) Containers.
						</p>
						<p>
							A project that I'm currently working on. It requires us to recode the vector, map, and stack
							containers; and ensure that it behaves similarly to the original implementation. In addition,
							we have also been tasked to implement certain features such as iterators, enable_if, is_integral,
							lexicographical compare, and pair.
						</p>
						<p>
							So far, I have been able to complete the vector and stack implementations, although further
							testing is required. As of now, I'm currently exploring how to encapsulate a binary search tree,
							specifically an AVL tree, and also implement its iterator.
						</p>
						<p>
							This will also be the first time where I'll be testing the time complexity of my project since I
							have to ensure that my implementation's time complexity does not exceed the original's by a
							large margin.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall, this project has extensively improved my knowledge and expertise in Object Oriented
							Programming (OOP), which improved my attention to detail and debugging skills.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Jul 2022 - Aug 2022">
						<h3>Cub3D</h3>
						<p>
							Co-designed a program that parses a two-dimensional map and renders its 3D representation
							to a window through the use of ray-casting techniques and numerous mathematical equations.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was responsible for implementing the ray-casting algorithms. I ensured that the graphical
							representation of each mathematical equation was correctly displayed in the window and that every
							input received from either the mouse or keyboard would smoothly translate over to a new frame.
						</p>
						<p>
							I also created a minimap system that provides information about the player's current whereabouts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, I learned how to create a Makefile that compiles a project with different compilation
							flags based on the current operating system being used.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Jul 2022">
						<h3>NetPractice</h3>
						<p>
							A practical exercise where I had the opportunity to learn about the fundamentals of TCP/IP
							addressing and configured small-scale networks with	the assistance of the 42 school’s
							training interface.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Jun 2022 - Jul 2022">
						<h3>C++ Modules</h3>
						<p>
							Completed nine C++ introductory modules where I learned about the following concepts: classes,
							inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, castings, templates, and STL containers.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Mar 2022 - Jun 2022">
						<h3>Minishell</h3>
						<p>
							Co-developed a shell terminal that mimics certain behaviors of GNU’s Bash terminal.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was responsible for parsing user input, error and memory management, and recoding 7 specific
							builtins. All of which were extremely challenging due to the numerous possibilities of user input
							combinations that I had to validate.
						</p>
						<p>
							This was also the first project where I had to work with a partner. Which I found to be extremely
							fun since it gave me a glimpse of how a software developer collaborates with their team.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall, this project tremendously reinforced my expertise in teamwork, error and memory management,
							debugging, and testing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Feb 2022 - Mar 2022">
						<h3>Philosophers</h3>
						<p>
							Created a simulator for the Dining Philosophers problem and discovered the concepts of
							concurrent programming.
						</p>
						<p>
							From this project, I was able to learn about multi-threading, mutexes, deadlocks, and data
							races. The proper application of these concepts proved to be quite a challenge, particularly the
							prevention of data races. Since I initially had an approach that relied on a single structure
							for all my threads.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Jan 2022 - Feb 2022">
						<h3>Push Swap</h3>
						<p>
							A simple algorithm project where data needs to be sorted using two stacks.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through this project, I was able to explore various sorting algorithms and learn about their
							ideal applications. At a similar timeframe, I also learned about the stack data structure
							methods/operations. Since I had to implement them, I viewed this as an opportunity to improve
							my proficiency in linked list creation, traversal, and manipulation.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Nov 2021 - Dec 2021">
						<h3>Fract'ol</h3>
						<p>
							A graphical project that prints fascinating fractals to a window.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first project where I've worked with a graphics library. Discovered	the principles behind
							escape-time fractals. I also learned about the RGB and hexadecimal color code format and conversions.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Nov 2021">
						<h3>Minitalk</h3>
						<p>
							Created a small data exchange program that communicates via UNIX signals.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project introduced me to the concept of UNIX signals and bitwise operators. It was a short
							exercise that required the creation of two binaries; one of which is a client that sends out a
							string to an ongoing program's process ID, and the other is a server that prints its process ID
							and simply waits for any incoming connections.
						</p>
						<p>
							On top of all that, I also learned how to compile two different binaries in a single Makefile, thanks
							to this project.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Oct 2021 - Nov 2021">
						<h3>FT_Printf</h3>
						<p>
							My implementation of the C Library's printf() function.
						</p>
						<p>
							The 42 school's printf project was a great exercise that introduced me to the concepts and
							basic applications of variadic functions and variadic arguments. Through this project, I
							have begun to work with structures due to the difficulties I encountered when refactoring
							my code along with the limitations set by the school's Norm convention.
						</p>
						<p>
							Furthermore, this was also the first project where I had to create a Makefile that relies
							on another Makefile's output, which was quite the challenge at the time.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Oct 2021">
						<h3>Born 2 be Root</h3>
						<p>
							A system administration exercise about virtualization.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project was my introduction to the existence of virtual machines. I was tasked to set up a
							simple server under specific guidelines which will be used to host a local WordPress website.
						</p>
						<p>
							From this learning opportunity, I have learned how virtual machines work, their setup process,
							installing services such as SSH and UFW, implementing password policies, the importance of SUDO
							privileges, and LVM partitioning.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Oct 2021">
						<h3>Get Next Line</h3>
						<p>
							Coded a function that returns a new line read from a file descriptor.
						</p>
						<p>
							I began to fully understand what file descriptors were, thanks to this project. It also clarified
							all my misunderstandings about static variables and static functions. Moreover, it was the first
							project where I had to handle memory leaks, which taught me how to use a tool called Valgrind.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="event" data-date="Sep 2021 - Oct 2021">
						<h3>Libft</h3>
						<p>
							My first C library.
						</p>
						<p>
							A project where I had to recode a few of the commonly used standard functions in C programming. These
							functions enhanced my expertise in string manipulation and provided multiple opportunities to understand
							and apply memory allocations.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to the various string manipulation functions, I also learned how to create and manipulate
							a linked list.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, I also learned how to create a Makefile that compiles and creates an archive of my project.
